-- 1. Create two tables:
--   `houses` has an id (primary key), name (text), a sigil (text) and a motto (text)
--   `people` has an id (primary key), name (text), weapon (text), and age (integer)
CREATE TABLE houses (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT,
sigil TEXT,
motto TEXT);

CREATE TABLE people (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT,
weapon TEXT,
age, INTEGER);

-- 2. Create at least three houses and three people with varying attributes.
INSERT INTO houses (name, sigil, motto) VALUES ('Lanasters', 'the lion', 'we always pay out debts');
INSERT INTO houses (name, sigil, motto) VALUES ('starks', 'the wolf', 'we are the good people');
INSERT INTO houses (name, sigil, motto) VALUES ('targarians', 'dragon', 'our dragons will kill you');

INSERT INTO people (name, weapon, age) VALUES ('rob stark', 'giant sward', '25');
INSERT INTO people (name, weapon, age) VALUES ('The mountain', 'hands', '35');
INSERT INTO people (name, weapon, age) VALUES ('little girl', 'twig', '13');

-- 3. Write a query to get all attributes of people greater than a certain age *or* having a specific weapon.
SELECT * FROM people WHERE age > 15;

--I mis understood the question, and only did the age...it should be something like
SELECT * FROM people WHERE age > 15 OR weapon = 'giant sward';

-- 4. Change the motto of one of your houses. Look it up by its sigil, since you don't know the ID.
UPDATE houses SET motto = 'we''ll stab you in the back' WHERE sigil = 'the lion';

-- 5. Kill off, er, I mean delete one of your people. Look them up by their name, since you don't know the ID.
DELETE FROM people WHERE name = 'The mountain';
